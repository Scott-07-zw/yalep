        <h1>Common questions about... STAYING SAFE</h1>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="images/3C4A5542 2.jpg" alt="Staying Safe Illustration">
        </div>
        
        <p>Staying Safe is about looking after yourself and caring for others. As we grow up, the way we think, feel and view the world changes. We are developing our identity, forming new kinds of relationships and trying different things. Growing up is a time of excitement and discovery, but we can face risks and challenges that we need to be prepared to deal with on our own.</p>
        
        <p>Staying safe is partly about knowing the difference between healthy and unhealthy relationships and knowing when people may be exploiting and abusing us or putting people at risk. It's also about knowing how to stand up for ourselves and others, and how to get the help and support we need.</p>

        <h2>Question 1: My father is drinking all the time and has started hitting my mother and threatening me. I just want her to leave him, what can I do?</h2>
        <p>We all have the right to feel safe, especially in our own homes. You and your mother should never feel threatened or unsafe at home and you can get help and support from organisations that help families. Check local links for services.</p>
        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Call <strong>393</strong> for help and support.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Question 2: A teacher at school is hassling me to go out with him. I don't want to, but am worried about offending him in case he gives me bad grades, what should I do?</h2>
        <p>Teachers hold positions of responsibility, and your teacher is abusing his power by asking you to go out with him. Schools and colleges have strict rules that teachers should follow, to keep all students safe. Your teacher will know that what he's doing is wrong. He may have tried this before with other students and may have got away with it and he's also likely to try this again.</p>
        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> It's important that you find someone to talk to about this – maybe a trusted family member or someone at school. Remember, this is not your fault, and this should not be happening. If the people you tell don't believe you, or won't help you, then find someone who will.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Question 3: I feel embarrassed and ashamed when my friends shout sexual comments at girls on the street; how can I get them to stop?</h2>
        <p>Shouting sexual comments, or 'cat calling' someone, is sexual harassment and a type of sexual abuse. Sadly, many girls and women experience this type of abuse daily. It can make them feel scared, angry, and sad. People shouldn't be made to feel like this, and it will only stop if we stand up to this type of behaviour by being strong, and challenging the people we know are doing this.</p>
        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Don't be a bystander! Remember that this happens to your sister, mother and girlfriend and they don't like it.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Question 4: One of my friends boasts about how he gets girls drunk so that he can have sex with them; he says that they deserve it for getting drunk. How can we stop him?</h2>
        <p>Sex without consent is rape! And rape is a serious crime. People cannot give consent to sex if they're drunk or high or when they are asleep. Read more about consent in the Q&A on Sex and other stuff.</p>
        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If your friend will not listen, and you think that this is not just boasting but he poses a risk, you must report him. You may want to find someone to talk to your friend as he may need support to deal with this behaviour. You may also want to think about finding other friends who share the same values as you.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Question 5: I was raped and I am worried that no one will believe me and that I might be pregnant. What should I do?</h2>
        <p>You're going through a traumatic experience and you're not to blame in any way for what happened to you. It's important that you tell someone that you trust and who can help you take action – you will need support at this time in your life. There are many things to think through, including finding out whether you are pregnant, and reporting the rape to authorities.</p>
        <ul class="checklist">
            <li>You need to access clinical services for post abuse care within 72 hours.</li>
            <li>Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) may also be available where you live to prevent HIV infection.</li>
            <li>PEP needs to be taken within a maximum of 3 days (72 hours) of the assault in order to work, and the sooner you take them, the better.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Rape is a serious crime and the person who did this to you is accountable for his actions. Think about telling a trusted adult, such as a family member or someone you know well in the community. If you would find it easier to speak to a trained counsellor first, you can call or text. Call <strong>393</strong> for help and support.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Question 6: I had sex with someone I thought really liked me. Now I've found out that they videoed us having sex and have shared it on social media. How can I make them delete the video?</h2>
        <p>Sharing sexual images without someone's consent is wrong and, in many places, it is a crime. This is especially true if the images are of a person who is under 18, or considered a minor.</p>
        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Remember you have done nothing wrong – expressing your sexuality is natural and a private experience. The person is wrong for breaking your trust. It can be very distressing to know that others are seeing images of you and it is really important that you get support and talk to someone about how you're feeling.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Question 7: My friend's partner is becoming increasingly controlling. Last time I went round to her house he said that she wasn't at home, but I could see her through the window. What should I do to help her?</h2>
        <p>It can be extremely hard to see our friends in relationships that we feel aren't right, with partners who are controlling and prevent them from seeing friends and family. It is important that you check your friend is OK.</p>
        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Try to find a way to meet your friend outside her home. For example, you could go to her school or workplace at lunch time, or around the time that she arrives or leaves or to where she does grocery shopping or goes to church. Be honest and tell her you're worried about her and ask her if she's OK or needs help.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Question 8: My friend keeps making me go with her to the motor park at night to hang out, the drivers buy us food and joke around with us, my friend flirts with them but I just get a bad feeling?</h2>
        <p>If you are uncomfortable in a situation, you should trust your instincts and remove yourself from it. Being aware of your environment and the people around you is so important in staying safe.</p>
        
        <h2>Question 9: My sister has a learning disability and has started to take an interest in boys. No one has talked to her about sex because my parents say there's no need and they still treat her like a young child but I'm worried about her.</h2>
        <p>All young people need and deserve information on sex and sexuality and access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services, including family planning, to have safe and pleasurable sex and to prevent pregnancy and STIs, including HIV. This includes young people with disabilities, who are often denied this information because other people think that they are not interested in sex or shouldn't be sexually active.</p>
        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Encourage her to be open with you and to ask any questions that she may have. You can also offer to go with her to the clinic with her and ask about information and services that meet her needs.</p>
