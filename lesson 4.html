        <h1>Common questions about... BEING A YOUNG PARENT</h1>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="images/pregnancy.jpg" alt="Young Parents Illustration">
        </div>
        
        <p>Having a baby and becoming a parent is life-changing. A new baby can bring great joy, but bringing up a child is also really hard work, whether you're on your own or in a relationship. There can be many different emotions, depending on whether the pregnancy is planned or unplanned.</p>
        
        <p>Becoming a new mum or dad can feel overwhelming and lonely at times, and for young parents it can be even harder. Sometimes young parents are judged unfairly and face discrimination - even if they're doing a great job of parenting.</p>
        
        <p>You may feel like people don't trust you to make decisions that affect your baby and think that they know best.</p>
        
        <p>Meeting other parents, the same age, and having someone to talk to, can help you share experiences and feel confident about what you're doing.</p>

        <h2>Question 1: How do I know if I'm ready to have a baby?</h2>
        <p>Deciding to have a baby, and bring up a child, is a big decision. Having a child changes your life forever. Being a parent can be the most amazing experience, but it's also really tough and lots of work. Only you can decide if you feel ready to have a baby, but knowing what to expect can be helpful.</p>
        <ul class="checklist">
            <li><strong>Love and care</strong> - Children need parents who are loving, kind and patient to care for them, keep them safe and guide them as they grow up.</li>
            <li><strong>Resources, including money</strong> - Children need somewhere to live, clothes, food, and healthcare.</li>
            <li><strong>Time</strong> - Bringing up a child is a full-time job, especially when they are very young, and it can be hard to juggle school or work with having a baby.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note"><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you don't want to get pregnant, remember to use condoms and discuss other family planning options with your health care provider and with your partner.</div>
        
        <h2>Question 2: I'm not ready to become a father. What can I do to prevent a pregnancy?</h2>
        <p>Having a baby with someone, and becoming a father, is a big decision and responsibility. Having a child changes your life and it's important that you feel ready to fully commit to the mother and baby if that happens.</p>
        <p>If you're not ready to become a father, then it is your responsibility to ensure you are preventing an unplanned pregnancy. You should always use a condom when having sex!</p>
        <div class="note"><strong>NOTE:</strong> It's important that you're honest with her about how you're feeling, but you also need to accept your responsibility to support her as a mother, and your responsibility as a parent to care for and protect the baby.</div>
        
        <h2>Question 3: I am pregnant and feel so alone, who can help me with being a young mum?</h2>
        <p>Becoming a new mum or dad can feel overwhelming and lonely at times and, for young parents, it can be even harder. It can be difficult to meet other parents the same age, and you may be reluctant to join support groups for parents of all ages. Sometimes young parents are judged unfairly and face discrimination - even if they're doing a fantastic job of parenting.</p>
        <div class="note"><strong>NOTE:</strong> Meeting up with other pregnant girls or parents the same age as you can be really helpful. There are organisations that just provide support and advice for young parents, and support groups where you can feel comfortable to talk with others.</div>
        
        <h2>Question 4: What can I do to have a healthy pregnancy and give my baby the best start?</h2>
        <p>There are many things that you can do to have a healthy pregnancy and make sure that your baby has the best possible start in life. Looking after your physical and mental health in pregnancy is important. There are lots of things you can do to prepare for pregnancy by making changes in your life to stay healthy.</p>
        <div class="note"><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you think you might be pregnant, it's important to go to the doctors for a pregnancy test to get it confirmed. Your doctor will then give you dates for a series of ante-natal care (ANC) appointments to check your health and the development of your baby.</div>
        <div class="note"><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you are living with HIV your health provider can talk to you about how HIV treatment can ensure that HIV is not transmitted to your baby during pregnancy, birth or through breastfeeding.</div>
        
        <h2>Question 5: How much alcohol is safe to drink during pregnancy?</h2>
        <p>We don't fully understand the amount of alcohol that is safe in pregnancy, so the advice is not to drink any alcohol at all.</p>
        <p>Your baby can't process alcohol as well as you can, and too much alcohol can seriously affect their development.</p>
        
        <h2>Question 6: How often should I breastfeed my baby and when should I stop?</h2>
        <p>Breastfeeding has many benefits for babies and mums, providing all the nutrition a baby needs and important antibodies that protect against disease and infections. New-born babies should be breastfed "on demand" - this means as often as the child wants.</p>
        <div class="note"><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you have problems with breastfeeding, or your baby is not gaining weight, talk to your health worker and discuss feeding support or alternative feeding. If you are not able to breastfeed you should not feel guilty or be judged by anyone.</div>
        
        <h2>Question 7: My mother-in-law is really controlling and won't let me look after my baby myself; how can I get her to back off?</h2>
        <p>One of the challenges of becoming a parent is that everyone has different ideas about how best to bring up a child and wants to offer their advice - whether you want/need it or not. This is especially the case with young mothers. Your relatives are probably trying to be helpful, even though it may not feel like it!</p>
        
        <h2>Question 8: My boyfriend's family really wanted their first grandchild to be a boy; they blame me for having a girl. How can I respond?</h2>
        <p>Most of us don't mind whether we have a boy or girl when we become parents- having a healthy baby is more important. This makes it hard when other people - particularly those close to us - get their hearts set on having either a boy or a girl.</p>
        <div class="note"><strong>NOTE:</strong> Your baby's sex at birth can't be influenced, despite any myths you might have heard. The sex of a baby actually depends on whether the father's sperm is carrying an X for female or Y for male 'chromosome'.</div>
        
        <h2>Question 9: My baby won't stop crying; what can I do?</h2>
        <p>If you feel like your baby cries a lot, for a long time, and you find it hard to settle them, you're not alone. All babies cry sometimes, but some babies cry more than others. Because the baby can't tell us what is wrong it's difficult to know why they are crying. Being at home with a baby who cries a lot is tough to cope with.</p>
        
        <h2>Question 10: My partner says I don't give him any attention now that we've had a baby. I think he is jealous, but I'm so tired by the time the baby goes to bed that I don't have any energy for him.</h2>
        <p>Having a baby can feel overwhelming, especially if it's your first, and it can take up almost all your time and energy. This can be a difficult time for your relationship, and it's important for you and your partner to talk about how you're both feeling.</p>
        <div class="note"><strong>NOTE:</strong> Many new mums find that their partners put pressure on them to start having sex again when they're not physically or emotionally ready. New mums are advised not to have sex for 4-6 weeks after the birth - you may still not feel ready after this amount of time.</div>
        
        <h2>Question 11: I am not a good mother, I feel like giving up.</h2>
        <p>Having a baby leads to huge hormonal changes in a woman and this can trigger extreme emotions - especially in the first few days and weeks. Feelings of joy can quickly turn to sadness and worry. For many women, they are dealing with physical issues due to the birth- exhaustion and pain, as well as all the emotions.</p>
        <div class="note"><strong>NOTE:</strong> It is normal to expect to feel low and face struggles in the first few days. However, feelings of sadness and anxiety that go on for longer may be a sign of post-natal depression that can lead to you feeling isolated, inadequate and unable to cope. If you have post-natal depression you need to seek help.</div>
